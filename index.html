                    <p>In 1958, after leasing the first two Miracles singles, including “Got A Job” (a riposte to the Silhouettes’ No. 1 hit, “Get A Job”), to End Records in New York, Berry Gordy receives a royalty check for just $3.19. This motivates him to form his own company in Detroit, facilitated by an $800 loan from the Gordy family’s savings fund.

                    <p>Motown signs the Temptations in May 1961, and they begin working with Artists & Repertoire (A&R) head William ‘Mickey’ Stevenson. With group member Otis Williams, he writes the group’s first 45, “Oh Mother Of Mine,” producing it with Andre Williams.

                    <p>Motown prospers in the first half of 1962 with a major Mary Wells hit, but the boss still finds time to write songs as well as handle business. It takes Berry Gordy two hours to create “Do You Love Me,” which lyrically addresses his onetime lack of sex appeal – because he couldn’t dance. He cuts the track at Hitsville, adding his own vocal as a demo.

                    <p>After signing contracts in the spring of ’63, the quartet begins recording material intended for an album release on the Workshop Jazz label. Motown A&R head Mickey Stevenson, who co-produces the sessions, subsequently says, “No one in Detroit could out sing the Four Tops.” But the album is not released, and the group begins working on songs aimed at the pop market.

                    <p>“I Heard It Through The Grapevine” is written by Norman Whitfield and Barrett Strong, and Whitfield records it for the first time in 1966, with the Miracles. He cuts the song again in 1967 with Marvin Gaye, Gladys Knight & the Pips, and Bobby Taylor & the Vancouvers. The second of these, when released in September, is a major hit, only held out from No. 1 by the Monkees’ “Daydream Believer” and then the Beatles’ “Hello Goodbye.”

                    <p>Marvin’s “I Heard It Through The Grapevine” stays unreleased until August 1968, when it is added to his album In The Groove. Radio airplay forces Motown to ship the track as a 45 in November. After it reaches No. 1, In The Groove is given a new title: I Heard It Through The Grapevine.</p>
